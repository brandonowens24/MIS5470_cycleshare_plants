    "For the past few years, one of the local municipalities has organized a native plant sale. Residents can place orders for various plants and a consolidated order is placed with a nursery that specializes in plants that are native to Michigan. From one of the pages in their website, https://www.wildtypeplants.com/wholesale, you can download an Excel spreadsheet containing the price list. I've included the Excel file in the folder for this problem. If you take a look at it, you'll see that different plants are available in different order sizes such as a 38 cell flat of plugs or a 5 gallon bucket. In my MIS 4460/5460 class, a few student groups did their final project on trying to improve and automate the ordering process for the municipality. As part of this, they needed to do a bunch of data cleaning and wrangling to get the plant catalog into a format amenable for improving the process. In this first problem, we will use our new found Python skills to do various tasks related to data cleaning and data wrangling. Instead of working with the entire catalog Excel file, I've created a csv file containing just the price list for the wildflowers. The file is called *wildflowers.csv* and here's what it looks like:\n",

So, let's just try to get the total price for each line item into a separate column. It's a little like what we were doing earlier, essentially splitting the column and keeping the first piece. However, it's a little trickier when you are working with pandas columns as opposed to individual string values. Also, we want the new price columns to be numeric and so we are going to have to deal with those pesky \\\\$ signs. We can assume that the \\\\$ may or may not be present and there may or may not be some space before the left paren. Our first goal is just to create a function that will take inputs that look like `test1` or `test2`, and return a numeric price (i.e. 45.22 for `test1` and 50.92 for `test2`). We CANNOT assume that prices are always xx.xx. They might be over \\\\$100 or less than \\\\$10. You CAN assume that if the price is less than \\\\$1, it will have a leading zero.\n",
